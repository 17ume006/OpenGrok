Thank you for proposing a contribution to the OpenGrok project. In order to accept changes from the outside world, all contributors must "sign" the [Oracle Contributor Agreement](www.oracle.com/technetwork/community/oca-486395.html) . It's an unfortunate reality of today's fuzzy and bizarre world of open-source ownership.
